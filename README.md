# LinearRegressionDataScience_IA_ML
This project analyzes CDC data on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. The goal is to explore the dataset, handle missing values, and build a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict obesity rates. The process includes data cleaning, preprocessing, splitting data into training and test sets, and evaluating model performance.
