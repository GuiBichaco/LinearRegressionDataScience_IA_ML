# LinearRegressionDataScience_IA_ML
This project involves the analysis of a dataset from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that includes information on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. The primary objective is to explore the data, preprocess it, and build a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict obesity rates based on variables such as physical activity, nutrition, and sample size. The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and evaluating the model's performance.



The use of the DataFrame (CSV file in the repository) is required for the project to function completely.
